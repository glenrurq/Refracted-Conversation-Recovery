                 Speech generates waves in the range of 300 Hz to 3400 Hz in the
                case of human voice. These sound waves vibrate nearby objects,
                making it possible for an analog electronic device to convert
                these vibrations into an audio signal. Refracted voice recovery
                is a concept involving a
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                microphone, a device commonly used in espionage. It uses a
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                beam to detect sound vibrations from a distant object and then
                recover noises using its surface vibrations. This technology can
                be used for spying with minimal risk of exposure, and has been
                employed by the

                confidential missions, which in most cases have resulted in
                resounding success.

              <p>
                The concept of capturing sound by analyzing vibrations reflected
                off surfaces dates back to the early 20th century. At that time,
                scientists were already experimenting with optical methods to
                detect sound, although the technology was not advanced enough to
                do so effectively. During the
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Guerra_Fr%C3%ADa"
                  >Cold War</a
                >
                (1947–1991), the
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB">KGB</a> and
                <a

                explored the possibility of listening to conversations remotely
                using advanced surveillance technologies. However, laser
                technology was not fully developed until the second half of the
                20th century. The technique of using a beam of light to record
                sound remotely was likely devised by Léon Theremin in the Soviet
                Union in or before 1947, when he developed and used the Buran
                spy system. This system operated by using a low-power infrared
                beam (not a laser) at a distance to detect vibrations in window
                panes. Lavrentiy Beria, director of the
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/KGB">KGB</a>, used the
                Buran system to spy on the American, British, and French
                embassies in Moscow. This highly effective method gradually
                gained popularity among other intelligence and security
                agencies.

              <p>
                The main purpose of a
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                microphone is to capture conversations within a room without
                having to place a listening device inside. To achieve this, it
                exploits the principle that any object within the room can
                vibrate slightly due to the pressure waves generated by sound.
                These vibrations are imperceptible to the human eye but can be
                detected using advanced optical techniques. <br /><br />
                The
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                microphone directs a coherent beam of light into the room
                through a window, with the intention that the beam hits a
                surface that vibrates subtly due to ambient sound. Ideally, the
                target should have a smooth, reflective surface, such as a
                picture on the wall, a hanging lamp, a glass bottle, or even the
                window itself. However, it is also possible to capture
                information if the beam reflects off less ideal surfaces,
                although with a loss in signal quality. <br /><br />
                Once the
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                hits the object within the room, it is reflected back to a
                receiver, usually a photodiode or interferometer, which is
                responsible for analyzing the variations in the reflected light.
                These variations are extremely subtle and are directly related
                to the vibrations of the object caused by the sound inside the
                room. They can also be affected by external factors.
                <br /><br />
                The fundamental principle behind modern
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                microphones is interferometry, which measures tiny changes in
                the distance traveled by light. When the object vibrates due to
                sound waves, the distance the light travels between the
                transmitter and receiver changes by tiny amounts, on the order
                of nanometers or even picometers. <br /><br />
                The interferometer detects these variations in the light's path
                length and translates them into fluctuations in light intensity.
                These changes are then electronically processed by circuits that
                convert the optical signal into an electrical signal that
                represents the original sound in the room. Once the electrical
                signal is obtained, it can be amplified and filtered to improve
                the intelligibility of the captured audio. These amplifiers are
                similar to those in a speaker or microphone, but on a larger
                scale.
                <br /><br />
                In some cases, instead of aiming directly at an object within
                the room, the
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                beam can be reflected off the window itself. Since glass also
                vibrates in response to sound waves from within, it can act as a
                "membrane" that transmits vibrations to the reflected light
                beam. However, this method presents some challenges, as windows
                often have multiple layers of glass and coatings that can affect
                the quality of the reflected signal. <br /><br />
                To improve the effectiveness of the
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                microphone, operators often look for specific points where the
                vibration is most pronounced, or even employ techniques such as
                using multiple
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                beams to improve the accuracy of the interferometric analysis.

                and the FBI are known to have employed this technology in
                surveillance missions. In the fight against terrorism and
                organized crime,
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                microphones have reportedly been used to capture conversations
                from safe distances without the need to place physical devices
                in the target area. In several high-profile investigations,
                federal agents have used this technology to monitor clandestine
                meetings of suspects without being detected. <br /><br />
                Laser microphones have also found applications in engineering
                and structural safety. Researchers at
                <a
                  href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laboratorio_Nacional_Lawrence_Berkeley"
                  >Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory</a
                >
                have used advanced laser systems to analyze vibrations in
                buildings and bridges. This technique allows structural failures
                to be detected without physical contact, which is especially
                useful in older structures or bridges in use where traditional
                inspection could be dangerous. <br /><br />
                In the medical field, researchers at the University of Illinois
                have developed a
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a>
                microphone-based technique to analyze the vibration of patients'
                vocal cords. This noninvasive method can detect speech disorders
                or early signs of neurological diseases such as Parkinson's
                disease, without the need to place electrodes or devices on the
                patient's throat. <br /><br />
                In 2019, the U.S. Army announced the development of a
                <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A1ser">laser</a
                >-based system capable of capturing long-distance conversations
                by detecting vibrations in different surfaces. It was suggested
                that this technology could be used in military reconnaissance
                operations, allowing the armed forces to obtain information
                without having to deploy troops to the target area.

            A laser microphone is an advanced listening device that uses a laser
            beam to detect vibrations in surfaces, such as windows or walls, and
            convert them into audio signals. This technology is used in
            security, investigation, and espionage applications, allowing
            conversations to be picked up remotely without physical contact with
            the sound source. It works by using reflected laser interference,
            which varies according to the sound vibrations on the target
            surface, resulting in a clear and precise audio signal.
